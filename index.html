            <h2>The Awesome Flexbox</h2>
            <p>Flexbox, I thought to myself this is an impressive feature. A no brainer. Well, unline CSS grid. I find flexbox a more relaxed way in aligning information.</p>
            <p>I used Flexbox in my header and navigation using a wrapper div as the parent element. Use the developer tool and inspect (right-click the screen and choose, Inspect Element) and learn how I designed the sticky navigation.</p>
            <p>Still have to understand that there are things to learn not just adding the display: flex; I found out the easiest way to learn something is by a game. <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com" class="blog-underline" >Here is the link to where you could learn while enjoying it.</a></p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed it because I did.</p>

        <div class="article-design-two">
            <h2>The Fantastic CSS Grid</h2>    
            <p>You'll probably ask, does CSS grid comes with a learning game too like Flexbox? Yah, it is called <a href="http://cssgridgarden.com" class="blog-underline"> Garden. Have a blast</a>.</p>
            <p>I admit I have not finished it yet since I want to finish this project first. It took me a whole lot of time in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu" class="blog-underline">accessibility testing</a>. Remember, Udacity asked to download the axe extension on Chrome. And my iMac for some reason went haywire. Restarted the Chrome browser every time it won't appear for some reason.</p> 
            <p>Back to CSS Grid. A handy tool for us developers. Very intuitive. Laying out your page as you wanted is easy as long you know how to understand the column and row placement. I learned how to use the property, grid-area and found out you have to precisely lay out the plan in a paper or in your mind to get the placement of each Element where you want it to be. Fun!</p>
            <p>Enjoy the trip. It's a whole new world.</p>

            <h2>Do you know?</h2>
            <p>March. My husband, up until now has been bedridden and with COVID-19 isolation, has been placed on the entire nation. Not being with him is hard to bear. I have been sketching his cat character since the third quarter of 2018,
            but I was putting off because of lack of time.
            To fight the constant depression, I started to draw his cat character again using Adobe Illustrator and a Wacom Tablet. I finally finished it between August of 2019 and put it up as a sticker app in the App store. It helped me with my situation. Kept me busy.
            <p>Joygi the Cat Sticker App is downloadable for .99 cents at the apple store. It was in my mind one way to pay the bills since I stopped working.</p>
            <p>But right now learning to code will be one way for me to earn more when hired eventually. I believe God has his reasons why things happen the way they do.</p>
            <p>Keeping my faith and trust, I know my husband will fight this.</p>

            <p>Building this 3 page, HTML5 and CSS3 is no joke. Filling up the content of each readable space is no laughing matter. I have summed up my English grammar. I hope my teacher is proud of me. I am so happy I listened and study hard during my younger years. I love you, teacher!</p>
