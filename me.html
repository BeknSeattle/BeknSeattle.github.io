            <h3>To have benefits or not</h3>
            <p>I dived into Graphic Design because I love design. I learned solely by research and taking online-courses. Having a playground, Joygibek was great. I had a few stable and fix clients through the years of learning the ins and out. Now I am still learning to get a permanent job and be out of the freelancing business. It is fun but benefit-wise; it is not, next, after finding a job. Get a degree to show that you are worthy now of climbing up  towards a higher salary and better position in the company.</p>
