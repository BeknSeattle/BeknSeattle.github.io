            <p>I am learning while dealing with Covid-19 epidemic. I am coping with being far from the only family I have. It is not a happy day for anyone. For those who have lost someone and battling with this unseen enemy, be strong. And for those who are like me. My prayers are with you.</p>
            <h3>Three days doing layout</h3>
            <p>I have been focusing on my Blog Website for three consecutive days. At least a good 2-3 hours in the morning and if I am lucky another 2 hours at night. I thought I hit the home run but lo and behold.</p>
            <p>I found the checklist. I have so many things to do, not just learning how to apply the CSS Grid and Flexbox, but you have to learn the proper CSS formatting Rules, HTML rules, CSS style rules among others. Now I am on the third day and trying to write down the design system for the site. Tomorrows another day. March 30, 2020.</p>
            <p>Keep on Learning.</p>
            <h3>Three days doing layout</h3>
            <p>JavaScript looks so cool on the browser but learning it makes my head hurts. I have also to get the free JavaScript lesson that Udacity. I was bouncing from Program propper to basic JavaScript. Let's say the quizzes in the JavaScript tutorial was not easy. Some code that returns correctly in the test run still read wrong, and you have to understand
            why ran an error. It is more and more confusing to me.</p>
            <p>But alas, we have to learn. And learning means getting bruises and scrapes along the way. Have fun learning. I am at 85% and still going back and forth to make sure I understood every context. April 15, 2020.</p>

            <p>Learning amid Covid-19 Outbreak. Not being with my husband, who is the hospital at this moment with his
                underlying illness. I miss you, and my efforts in studying are for you. I will see you soon.</p>
            <p>Thank you Udacity for giving us one month free of Nanodegree program of our choice. March 29, 2020.

            <h3>Wooh, Hard work!</h3>
            <p>Building this 3 page, HTML5 and CSS3 is no joke. Filling up the content of each readable space is no
                laughing matter. I have summed up my English grammar. I hope my teacher is proud of me. I am so happy I
                listened and study hard during my
                younger years. I love you, teacher!</p>

            <p>As much as I want to put my pictures and whatnot. It doesn't jive with this layout, so I utilized the works of Ivan Haidustski and Murat Kalkavan and Sara Maese. Find their illustration at <a href="https://icons8.com">icon8.com.</a></p>
